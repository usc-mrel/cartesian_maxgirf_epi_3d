Testing (validation and performance) directory for GPU FINUFFT.

All codes test either precision (souce is templated to allow switching
via the final command line argument "f" or "d").

cufinufft{1,2,3}d_test: accuracy/speed tests for single transform
                   in a given dimension, either type 1 or 2.
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
                   Call with no arguments for argument documentation.
cufinufft2dmany_test: accuracy/speed tests for vectorized transforms
                   in 2D only, either type 1 or 2.
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
                   Call with no arguments for argument documentation.
public_api_test:   tests guru plan C++ interface for GPU on tiny problem.
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
test_makeplan:     test edge cases, illegal inputs in API, and error codes
                   (exit code 0 is a pass).
