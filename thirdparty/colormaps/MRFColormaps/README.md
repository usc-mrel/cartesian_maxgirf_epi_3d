Colormaps for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting

This repository houses some of the basic colormaps that have been developed at Case Western Reserve University originally presented by Griswold et al at ISMRM 2018 for use in displaying Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) maps. These should be considered beta versions and will almost definitely change in the coming year. 

The maps used in the 2019 ISMRM abstract from Obmann et al are contained in a subfolder here.
